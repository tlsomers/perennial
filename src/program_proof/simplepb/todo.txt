[X] `src/goose_lang/lib/waitgroup/waitgroup.v`; some pure admits, and
 one admitted proof for WaitGroup.Wait().

[X] `src/program_proof/simplepb/pb_marshal_proof.v`; admits in
 wp_DecodePrimaryArgs (revolving around for loop for unmarshaling list of
 hostnames).

[x] Axiomatized ffi: `src/goose_lang/ffi/grove_filesys_axioms.v`.
 3 operations: Read, Write, AtomicAppend.

[ ] `src/program_proof/simplepb/config_marshal_proof.v`; admit in pure lemma
    `list_copy_one_more_element`. The proof that uses the lemma can probably be
    done without the lemma, basically the same as BecomePrimaryArgs's wp_Decode
    since it has a list of grove_ffi.Addresses.
