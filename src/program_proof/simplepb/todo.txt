[ ] `src/program_proof/simplepb/simplelog/proof.v`;
    Added some unproven lemma about file_encodes_state.
    Bunch of pure admits about overflow.
    Most of them show up in the recovery function, which is where we decode
    state.

[x] `src/program_proof/simplepb/pb_definitions.v`; contractiveness of is_pb_host_pre

[x] `src/program_proof/simplepb/pb_apply_proof.v`;
    [x] wp_random
    [x] prefix_app_cases; it's only used once and in that file, so we can also
    get rid of that lemma and change the proof where it's used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't look at state_proof.v. state_proof is an old app-level proof, and I'm
currently copying stuff in it and changing it as part of simplepb/app/kv_proof.v
