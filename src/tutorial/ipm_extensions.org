#+TITLE: IPM extensions

You can follow along in the demo file associated with this tutorial by just
building that file, with ~make -j4 src/tutorial/ipm_extensions.vo~ (should only
take a couple minutes). You will need to initialize the submodules (~git
submodule init~) to get stdpp, iris, and string-ident.

* Introduction
Perennial is a research project on verified concurrent storage systems.
** Iris (concurrency)
** Crash program logic (storage)
** Verifying Go programs (systems)
* iNamed
named propositions
** [[file:ipm_extensions.v::first extension][Coq demo]]
** "simple" example [[file:../program_proof/wal/sliding_proof.v::is_sliding][sliding abstraction relation]]
** really hairy usage [[file:../program_proof/wal/invariant.v::Definition memLog_linv γ][wal memLog_linv]]
** examples in Hoare logic [[file:../program_proof/examples/inode_proof.v::wpc_Inode__Append][inode append wpc]], [[file:../program_proof/examples/inode_proof.v::wpc_Write_fupd][applying wpc_Write]]
* iCache
caching subproofs
** [[file:ipm_extensions.v::second extension][Coq demo]]
** arises in crash safety since crash conditions are repetitive
** simple example [[file:../program_proof/examples/replicated_block_proof.v::wpc_RepBlock__Read][replicated block Read]]
** integration with [[file:../goose_lang/wpc_proofmode.v::tac_wpc_wp_frame_cache][wpc_frame]]
* Restore
destruct and then reconstruct (WIP)
** [[file:ipm_extensions.v::third extension][Coq demo]]
** often want to read from an abstraction relation
** restoring the persistent parts is annoying
** egregious example [[file:../program_proof/wal/logger_proof.v::iFrame "# % ∗"][iFrame "# % ∗"]]
