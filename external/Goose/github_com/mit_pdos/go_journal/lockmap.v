(* lockmap is a sharded lock map.

   The API is as if LockMap consisted of a lock for every possible uint64
   (which we think of as "addresses", but they could be any abstract location);
   LockMap.Acquire(a) acquires the lock associated with a and
   LockMap.Release(a) release it.

   The implementation doesn't actually maintain all of these locks; it
   instead maintains a fixed collection of shards so that shard i is
   responsible for maintaining the lock state of all a such that a % NSHARDS = i.
   Acquiring a lock requires synchronizing with any threads accessing the same
   shard. *)
